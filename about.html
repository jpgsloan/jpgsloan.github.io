                  About me
                </em>
                I am a passionate software engineer and musician who loves to solve problems and be creative. I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of California Berkeley in May 2014. During my studies at Berkeley, I procured an in-depth background in computer science that has prepared me to be a quick learner in any situation.

              <p>
                I have industry experience in software engineering and the initiative to get things done independently. After leaving my engineering role at Kinoma in early 2015, I went straight to work developing my own music iOS apps while applying for graduate school. With no prior experience in iOS mobile development, I was able to pick up Swift and Objective-C quickly in order to build an app I had wanted to make for years. <a href='./projects/tracks.html' class='link-color'>Tracks</a>, an app for mobile songwriting, is the culmination of my passions and my first attempt at using my programming skills to improve the music world in some way. The app is now in beta on TestFlight and will hit the app store soon.

                In fall 2016, I will begin the next chapter in my education. I have been accepted to the Music Technology Master's program at New York University, Steinhardt. I am thrilled to further expand my software engineering abilities while exploring the intersection of music and computer science.
